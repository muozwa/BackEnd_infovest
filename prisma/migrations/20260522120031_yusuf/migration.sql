/*
  Warnings:

  - You are about to drop the column `date_event` on the `events` table. All the data in the column will be lost.
  - You are about to drop the column `location` on the `events` table. All the data in the column will be lost.
  - You are about to drop the `speakers` table. If the table is not empty, all the data it contains will be lost.
  - Added the required column `pembicara_id` to the `events` table without a default value. This is not possible if the table is not empty.
  - Added the required column `tanggal` to the `events` table without a default value. This is not possible if the table is not empty.
  - Changed the type of `category_id` on the `events` table. No cast exists, the column would be dropped and recreated, which cannot be done if there is data, since the column is required.
